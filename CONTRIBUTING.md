# Contributing

Thanks for helping! Pocket AMP Upgrader is a small community tool, and the most useful contributions right now do not need any code.

## The most helpful things you can do

1. **Test it on your system and report back.** Windows and macOS have not been tested with a real pedal yet. Even "it detected my pedal" is valuable. Use the [hardware test report](../../issues/new?template=hardware_report.yml) form.
2. **Report bugs** with the log from **Details → Copy for a bug report** in the app ([bug report form](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)).
3. **Share what you know** about the pedal, other M-VAVE devices or the JieLi update protocol in [Discussions](../../discussions).
4. **Improve the docs**: clearer steps, screenshots, translations of the README.

## Safety first

This app writes firmware. A bad change can leave someone's pedal unusable, so:

- Never test unreviewed update code on a pedal you cannot afford to lose.
- The read-only path is safe to test: opening the app only sends the identity query (`0x11`).
- Changes to the update path (`lib/src/pedal_updater.dart`, `lib/src/ota_protocol.dart`, `lib/src/midi/`) need a test against the simulated pedal in `test/support/fake_pedal.dart` and a clear description of how they were checked.
- Do not loosen the safety checks (known loader hash, product name, final identity) without discussing it in an issue first.
- Do not commit firmware files (`.fwsc`, `.bin`). They belong to M-VAVE; the app downloads them from M-VAVE's server.

## Development

Requires Flutter 3.47 or newer.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
flutter run -d linux   # or windows / macos
```

- `test/` runs anywhere, with a simulated pedal.
- `test_hardware/` talks to a real pedal on Linux and only reads its identity.
- Set `POCKET_AMP_FWSC=/path/to/firmware.fwsc` to also run the tests against an official package.

Project layout:

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/src/firmware_package.dart` | `.fwsc` parsing and validation |
| `lib/src/ota_protocol.dart` | SysEx framing of the update protocol |
| `lib/src/pedal_updater.dart` | detection and the update procedure |
| `lib/src/midi/` | native USB-MIDI per platform (ALSA, WinMM, CoreMIDI) |
| `lib/src/ui/` | the single-screen interface |

## Pull requests

- Keep each PR focused on one change.
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages (`fix: ...`, `feat: ...`, `docs: ...`).
- `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` must pass; CI builds all three platforms.
- Say in the PR which systems and pedals you tested on, if any.

## Supporting other pedals

The FM-1 and other M-VAVE devices built on the JieLi AC791N may use the same update loader. Support for another product needs the package details and a successful update reported by an owner of that device. Open a discussion first.
